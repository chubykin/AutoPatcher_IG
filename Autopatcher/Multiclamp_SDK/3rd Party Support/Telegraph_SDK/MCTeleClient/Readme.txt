Axon Knowledge Base Article # 737

Question
Can you provide any additional information on programming with the MultiClamp 700B Software Development Kit (SDK)? 

Answer
Axon does not provide any specific technical support of the MultiClamp Software Development Kit. However, users of the SDK can follow this advice to get the example working: 
- Ensure they are using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ v6 or later.
- Do not try to 'compile the files', instead, 'build the project', which is the .dsp file.
- Read "Programming Microsoft Visual C++", Kruglinski (Microsoft Press).
- Hire a programmer who is fluent in C++ and Microsoft Foundation Class libraries.
